    <h1>My Baby's Back 💕</h1>

    <p><b>Hey Kiki,</b></p>

    <p>
        I don’t even know where to start, because there’s so much I’ve been holding in while you were away. 
        Every day you were in school, there was this quiet space next to me that only you can fill. 
        I missed your voice, your laugh, your presence, your energy — I missed <b>you</b> in every possible way.
    </p>

    <p>
        The days felt longer without you. Nights felt colder. Even the little things reminded me of you — 
        random songs, quiet moments, late thoughts, and soft memories that kept replaying in my head. 
        You were always on my mind, and not a single day passed without me wishing you were here with me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now that you’re back, my heart finally feels complete again. You don’t understand how much comfort 
        your presence brings me. You are my peace, my happiness, my favorite feeling. Having you back feels 
        like breathing fresh air after holding my breath for too long.
    </p>

    <div class="poem">
        <h2>A Love Poem for You 💌</h2>

        <p>
            I missed you in the silence of the night,<br>
            In the lonely stars, in the soft moonlight.<br>
            I missed your voice, your gentle touch,<br>
            Every little thing — I missed you <b>that much.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Distance tried, but love stood strong,<br>
            Every second felt way too long.<br>
            My heart stayed yours, loyal and true,<br>
            Counting down the days till I’d be back with you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now you’re here, and the world feels right,<br>
            Colors are brighter, days feel light.<br>
            My heart beats louder, my smile feels new,<br>
            Because my favorite place is right with you.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="final">
        <p>
            And now… brace yourself 😌<br><br>
            Because I’ve been saving up all the <b>“I love yous”</b>, all the hugs, all the kisses, 
            all the sweet words, all the affection, and all the love I couldn’t give you while you were away — 
            and trust me… <b>I’m about to FLOOD you with them.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            So get ready, beautiful…<br>
            Because your boyfriend is about to be extremely, unapologetically, ridiculously in love with you. 💕
        </p>

        <p><b>Welcome back, my baby. I missed you more than words can ever explain. 😌❤️</b></p>
